# SimpleTasks
Simple Tasks is a lightweight task management application for the web.
It's completely free, uses AES encryption for tasks, and is open source!

## Running Locally
To run SimpleTasks on your own server, all you need is Meteor and a way to get the code on the server.

1. Install meteor with `curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh`
2. Run `git clone https://github.com/rymate1234/simple-tasks.git` to obtain the files
3. cd to the folder created and use the meteor command to run it!
